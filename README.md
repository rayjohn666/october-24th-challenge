# Code Refactoring Starter code (Challenge)

## Description
Refactored and improved function of html code so that links at the Heriseon homepage would work. I did quite a few consolidations on the css style sheet, for elements that had the same values in their properties.

- The purpose of this project was to learn mostly how to refactor prewritten code, but also to debug and problem solve.
- This was done as a weekly challenge for the coding course I am enrolled it to be better able to code, refactor, and troubleshoot without being directly supervised, though much support was available.
- Learned quite a bit through this project, I am much more confident in html and css, also become more efficient and the process has become more fluid for me (quicker, less roadblocks, and understanding the tools within vs code).
